#### Upon successful user creation using the registration.php page form, the data get saved on data.json.
#### login.php compares data against previously added data.json file. User will only be logged in when inputted data (e.g: username, password) matches with data.json data
#### change_pass.php also works the same way as login.php. First it compares the current values (e.g: username, current password) and then it changes the password on the data.json file.
